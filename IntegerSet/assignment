Provide the following methods: The static method union creates a set that’s the set-theoretic
union of two existing sets (i.e., an element of the new set’s array is set to true if that element
is true in either or both of the existing sets—otherwise, the new set’s element is set to false). 
The static method intersection creates a set which is the set-theoretic intersection of two 
existing sets (i.e., an element of the new set’s array is set to false if that element is false in 
either or both of the existing sets—otherwise, the new set’s element is set to true). Method 
insertElement inserts a new integer k into a set (by setting a[k] to true). Method 
deleteElement deletes integer m (by setting a[m] to false). Method toString returns a String 
containing a set as a list of numbers separated by spaces. Include only those elements that are 
present in the set. Use --- to represent an empty set. Method isEqualTo determines whether 
two sets are equal. Write a program to test class IntegerSet. Instantiate several IntegerSet 
objects. Test that all your methods work properly.
